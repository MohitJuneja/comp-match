A package that helps to compare company names, match company names to legal names and stock symbols and many more.

***\[WIP\]***

### Introduction

Given a company name, how to find its underline/stock symbol? By hand this does seem like a very difficult task, but what if we need to match a lof of them? In such case we need to find a simple and effective way to compare company names, match to stock symbols.

### Notes

1. Information is gathered from web and inaccuracy is inevitable. In particularly Google Finance and Yahoo Finance exchange mapping relies on some third party website and therefore may not be 100% correct. I am still trying to verify those information.
2. Tickers do change and currently there is not support for mapping over history yet.
